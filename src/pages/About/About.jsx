            Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
            Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they <br />
            live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
            language ocean. <br />  <br />On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the
            Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been
            rewritten a thousand <br /> times and everything that was left from its
            origin would be the word and and the Little Blind Text should turn
            around and return to <br /> its own, safe country. But nothing the copy
            said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few
            insidious Copy Writers <br /> ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and
            Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for
            their.
